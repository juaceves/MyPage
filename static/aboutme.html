                <h3>Overview</h3>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Julia Aceves and I am currently
                        a senior at the University of California, San Diego. 
                        I am majoring in Cognitive Science with a specialization
                        in Human-Computer Interaction. I enjoy learning and exploring
                        the subjects of design and human learning. It truly fascinates
                        me how, with the proper design, one can create tools that
                        are both user-friendly and powerful beyond imagination. This is
                        why I have chosen to pursue a career in User Interface Design
                        and Web Development. I enjoy working with technology and
                        absoultely find it critical to run all my ideas and creations
                        past the every day user to make sure that they are both
                        innovative and intuitive. I am currently pursuing an internship
                        or entry-level postion in the fields of UX/UI Design, Web
                        Design, or Front-End Web Development. Please see my resume
                        for further details.</p>
                <h4>Interests and Hobbies</h4>
                    <p>Art has always played a very important role in my life. I find
                that art has given me purpose and allowed me to express myself without 
                limitations. I enjoy music and occasinally pick up my guitar. Concerts 
                have also had a large influence on my designing style. Through music I
                found the world of tattoos and I fell in love with the artform. You 
                will find that my designs have been inspire by the Sacred Geometry and
                American Traditional style of tattooing. </p>
